## Why Code Review

##What Should Code Review Provide?

According to Jonathan Betz, a code review should idealy address six things:

1. Correctness

  Does the code do everything it claims?

2. Complexity

  Does it accomplish its goal in a straightforward way?

3. Consistency

  Does it achieve its goals consistently?

4. Maintainability

  Could the code be easily extended by another member of the team with a reasonable level of effort?

5. Scalability

  Is the code written in such a way that it would work for both 100 users and 10,000? Is it optimized?

6. Style

  Does the code adhere to a particular style guide (preferable one agreed upon by the team if the project is collaborative)?

so, what should do?

1. Make Effective Communication
  
  + Provide clear comments
  + demonstrate knowledge
  + point out the shortfalls in an implementation and give the reason why a particular approach isn't recommended
  + Suggest alternative solutions, either in a separate runnable form or integrated in the code via fork
  + Focus on solutions first, and style second. 
   
2.
